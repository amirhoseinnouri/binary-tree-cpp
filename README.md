Binary Tree in C++ A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. Binary trees are widely used in computer science for tasks such as searching, sorting, and hierarchical data representation.

Key Features of a Binary Tree Node Structure: Each node in the tree contains:

A value or data. A pointer to the left child. A pointer to the right child. Root Node: The topmost node in the tree is called the root. It serves as the entry point to the binary tree.

Leaf Nodes: Nodes that do not have any children are called leaf nodes.

Subtrees: Every node can act as the root of its own subtree.

Height of a Tree: The length of the longest path from the root to a leaf.

Depth of a Node: The distance from the root to that node.

Types of Binary Trees Full Binary Tree: Every node has 0 or 2 children. Complete Binary Tree: All levels, except possibly the last, are fully filled, and nodes are as far left as possible. Perfect Binary Tree: All interior nodes have 2 children, and all leaf nodes are at the same level. Binary Search Tree (BST): A special kind of binary tree where the left child is smaller than the parent, and the right child is greater. Basic Operations Binary trees support several operations, such as:

Insertion: Adding elements to the tree. Deletion: Removing elements while maintaining the tree's properties. Traversal: Inorder Traversal (Left, Root, Right) Preorder Traversal (Root, Left, Right) Postorder Traversal (Left, Right, Root) Search: Finding a specific element in the tree.
